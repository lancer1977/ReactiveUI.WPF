  - Themes: `dependencies, docs, tests`
  - Recommendations: Restore the required docs spine and make the repo's purpose/setup easy to find again., Repair or document the native test command so the repo has a trusted validation path., No obvious .NET lock or central-version file is present; run `dotnet list package --outdated` and decide whether this repo should adopt central package management before the next slice.
  - Dependency status: `warn`
    - `dotnet` manifests: `src/ReactiveUI.Wpf.csproj`
      - advice: No obvious .NET lock or central-version file is present; run `dotnet list package --outdated` and decide whether this repo should adopt central package management before the next slice.
